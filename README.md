# HLS Streaming Solution with Docker and AWS

## Overview

This project demonstrates the implementation of a High-Level Streaming (HLS) solution using Docker for containerization and Amazon Web Services (AWS) for storage and delivery infrastructure. HLS allows for adaptive bitrate streaming, enhancing user experience across various devices and network conditions.

## Tech Stack

- **Docker:** Leveraged Docker for containerization, enabling easy deployment and management of the streaming infrastructure.
- **AWS S3 Bucket:** Utilized Amazon S3 Bucket for secure and scalable storage of video assets, ensuring reliable delivery to viewers.
- **HLS (HTTP Live Streaming):** Implemented HLS to provide adaptive bitrate streaming, optimizing video delivery for scalability and reliability.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Docker installed on your system. You'll also need an AWS account with access to S3 services.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository::
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Ingole712521/HLS_Adaptive_Streaming.git
   ```

2. Build the Docker image:

   ```bash
   docker build -t video .
   ```
